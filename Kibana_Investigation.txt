Open the Metrics page for the web machine you attacked and answer the following questions:

Which of the VM metrics were affected the most from this traffic?
Outbound traffic was the most affected. Memory was also greatly affected.


Bonus: Notice that your wget loop creates a lot of duplicate files on your jump box.


Write a command to delete all of these files at once.
rm ./*.html*

Find a way to run the wget command without generating these extra files.


Look up the flag options for wget and find the flag that lets you choose a location to save the file it downloads.
-O

Save that file to the Linux directory known as the "void" or the directory that doesn't save anything.
/dev/null


while [ true ]; do wget -O /dev/null 10.0.0.9; done


Bonus: Write a nested loop that sends your wget command to all three of your web VMs over and over.

while [ true ];
do 
	wget -O /dev/null 10.0.0.9
    wget -O /dev/null 10.0.0.10

done
